# How to Contribute

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Adelante.
It's people like you that make Adelante such a great programming language.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate
that you respect the time of the developers
managing and developing this open source project.
In return, they should reciprocate that respect
in addressing your issue, assessing changes,
and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Adelante  is an open source project and we love
to receive contributions from our community â€” you!
There are many ways to contribute,
from writing tutorials or blog posts,
improving the documentation,
submitting bug reports and feature requests
or writing code which can be incorporated
into Adelante itself.

## Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every
  change that's accepted.
  Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Ensure that your code passes all checks that the build file
  enforces.
* Ensure that you provide test cases for all
  relevant parts of your code.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements
  that you wish to make.
  Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes or methods to the codebase unless absolutely needed.
  Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible,
  preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage
  diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
  See the Code of Conduct.

## Your First Contribution?

Unsure where to begin contributing to Adelante?
You can start by looking through the issues
marked with the label "help-wanted" and/or
"[first-timers-only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)".

Working on your first Pull Request?
You can learn how from this *free* series,
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes!
Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner
at first ðŸ˜¸

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR,
they're saying that a lot of code has changed,
and that you need to update your branch so it's
easier to merge.
