## Reporting a Vulnerability
Any security issues should be submitted directly
to peregrinus@planet.ms .

In order to determine whether you are dealing with
a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes",
then you're probably dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions,
you may still be dealing with a security issue,
so if you're unsure,
just email us at peregrinus@planet.ms .
